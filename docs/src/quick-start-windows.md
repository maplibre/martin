## Quick start on Windows

1. Download some [demo tiles](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/raw/main/tests/fixtures/mbtiles/world_cities.mbtiles).

2. Download the latest Windows version of Martin from
   the [release page](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/releases):  [martin-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip](https://github.com/maplibre/martin/releases/latest/download/martin-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)

3. Extract content of both files and place them in a same directory.
