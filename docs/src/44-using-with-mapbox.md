# Using with Mapbox

[Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) is a JavaScript library for interactive, customizable vector maps on the web. Mapbox GL JS v1.x was open source, and it was forked as MapLibre, so using Martin with Mapbox is similar to MapLibre described [here](41-using-with-maplibre.md). Mapbox GL JS can accept [MVT vector tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec) generated by Martin, and applies [a style](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/) to them to draw a map using Web GL.

You can add a layer to the map and specify Martin TileJSON endpoint as a vector source URL. You should also specify a `source-layer` property. For [Table Sources](32-sources-pg-tables.md) it is `{table_name}` by default.

```js
map.addLayer({
  id: 'points',
  type: 'circle',
  source: {
    type: 'vector',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/points'
  },
  'source-layer': 'points',
  paint: {
    'circle-color': 'red'
  }
});
```
