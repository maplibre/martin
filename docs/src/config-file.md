# Configuration File

If you don't want to expose all of your tables and functions, you can list your sources in a configuration file. To
start Martin with a configuration file you need to pass a path to a file with a `--config` argument. Config files may
contain environment variables, which will be expanded before parsing. For example, to use `MY_DATABASE_URL` in your
config file: `connection_string: ${MY_DATABASE_URL}`, or with a
default `connection_string: ${MY_DATABASE_URL:-postgresql://postgres@localhost/db}`

```bash
martin --config config.yaml
```

You may wish to auto-generate a config file with `--save-config` argument. This will generate a config yaml file with
all of your configuration, which you can edit to remove any sources you don't want to expose.

```bash
martin  ... ... ...  --save-config config.yaml
```

## Config Example

```yaml
# Connection keep alive timeout [default: 75]
keep_alive: 75

# The socket address to bind [default: 0.0.0.0:3000]
listen_addresses: '0.0.0.0:3000'

# Set TileJSON URL path prefix. This overrides the default of respecting the X-Rewrite-URL header.
# Only modifies the JSON (TileJSON) returned, martins' API-URLs remain unchanged. If you need to rewrite URLs, please use a reverse proxy.
# Must begin with a `/`.
# Examples: `/`, `/tiles`
base_path: /tiles

# Number of web server workers
worker_processes: 8

# Amount of memory (in MB) to use for caching tiles [default: 512, 0 to disable]
cache_size_mb: 1024

# If the client accepts multiple compression formats, and the tile source is not pre-compressed, which compression should be used. `gzip` is faster, but `brotli` is smaller, and may be faster with caching.  Default could be different depending on Martin version.
preferred_encoding: gzip

# Enable or disable Martin web UI. At the moment, only allows `enable-for-all` which enables the web UI for all connections. This may be undesirable in a production environment. [default: disable]
web_ui: disable

# Database configuration. This can also be a list of PG configs.
postgres:
  # Database connection string. You can use env vars too, for example:
  #   $DATABASE_URL
  #   ${DATABASE_URL:-postgresql://postgres@localhost/db}
  connection_string: 'postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/db'

  # Same as PGSSLCERT for psql
  ssl_cert: './postgresql.crt'
  # Same as PGSSLKEY for psql
  ssl_key: './postgresql.key'
  # Same as PGSSLROOTCERT for psql
  ssl_root_cert: './root.crt'

  #  If a spatial table has SRID 0, then this SRID will be used as a fallback
  default_srid: 4326

  # Maximum Postgres connections pool size [default: 20]
  pool_size: 20

  # Limit the number of geo features per tile.
  #
  # If the source table has more features than set here, they will not be included in the tile and the result will look "cut off"/incomplete.
  # This feature allows to put a maximum latency bound on tiles with extreme amount of detail at the cost of not returning all data.
  # It is sensible to set this limit if you have user generated/untrusted geodata, e.g. a lot of data points at [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island).
  max_feature_count: null # either a positive integer, or null=unlimited (default)

  # Control the automatic generation of bounds for spatial tables [default: quick]
  # 'calc' - compute table geometry bounds on startup.
  # 'quick' - same as 'calc', but the calculation will be aborted if it takes more than 5 seconds.
  # 'skip' - do not compute table geometry bounds on startup.
  auto_bounds: skip

  # Enable automatic discovery of tables and functions.
  # You may set this to `false` to disable.
  auto_publish:
    # Optionally limit to just these schemas
    from_schemas:
      - public
      - my_schema
    # Here we enable both tables and functions auto discovery.
    # You can also enable just one of them by not mentioning the other,
    # or setting it to false.  Setting one to true disables the other one as well.
    # E.g. `tables: false` enables just the functions auto-discovery.
    tables:
      # Optionally set how source ID should be generated based on the table's name, schema, and geometry column
      source_id_format: 'table.{schema}.{table}.{column}'
      # Add more schemas to the ones listed above
      from_schemas: my_other_schema
      # A table column to use as the feature ID
      # If a table has no column with this name, `id_column` will not be set for that table.
      # If a list of strings is given, the first found column will be treated as a feature ID.

      # Boolean to control if geometries should be clipped or encoded as is, optional, default to true
