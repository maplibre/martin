# Generating Tiles in Bulk

We offer the `martin-cp` tool for generating tiles in bulk, from any source(s) supported by Martin, and save retrieved tiles into a new or an existing MBTiles file.

`martin-cp` can be used to generate tiles for a large area or multiple areas (bounding boxes).
If multiple areas overlap, it will ensure each tile is generated only once
`martin-cp` supports the same configuration file and CLI arguments as Martin server, so it can support all sources and even combining sources.

After copying, `martin-cp` will update the `agg_tiles_hash` metadata value unless `--skip-agg-tiles-hash` is specified.
This allows the MBTiles file to be [validated](mbtiles-validation.md#aggregate-content-validation) using `mbtiles validate` command.

## Usage

This copies tiles from a PostGIS table `my_table` into an MBTiles file `tileset.mbtiles` using [normalized](mbtiles-schema.md#normalized) schema, with zoom levels from 0 to 10, and bounds of the whole world.

```bash
martin-cp  --output-file tileset.mbtiles \
           --mbtiles-type normalized     \
           "--bbox=-180,-90,180,90"      \
           --min-zoom 0                  \
           --max-zoom 10                 \
           --source source_name          \
           postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/db
```

> [!TIP]
> `--concurrency <CONCURRENCY>` and `--pool-size <POOL_SIZE>` can be used to control the number of concurrent requests and the pool size for postgres sources respectively.
>
> The optimal setting depends on:
>
> - the source(s) performance characteristics
> - how much load is allowed, for example in a multi-tenant environment
> - how to compress tiles stored in the output file

You should also consider

> [!TIP]
> `--encoding <ENCODING>` can be used to reduce the final size of the MBTiles file or decrease the amount of processing `martin-cp` does.
>
> The default `gzip` should be a reasonable choice for most use cases, but if you prefer a different encoding, you can specify it here.
> If set to multiple values like `'gzip,br'`, `martin-cp` will use the first encoding, or re-encode if the tile is already encoded and that encoding is not listed.
> Use `identity` to disable compression.
> Ignored for non-encodable tiles like PNG and JPEG.
