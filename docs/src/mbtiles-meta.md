# MBTiles information and metadata

## summary

Use `mbtiles summary` to get a summary of the contents of an MBTiles file. The command will print a table with the
number of tiles per zoom level, the size of the smallest and largest tiles, and the average size of tiles at each zoom
level. The command will also print the bounding box of the covered area per zoom level.

```bash
MBTiles file summary for tests/fixtures/mbtiles/world_cities.mbtiles

## meta-all

Print all metadata values to stdout, as well as the results of tile detection. The format of the values printed is not
stable, and should only be used for visual inspection.

```bash
mbtiles meta-all my_file.mbtiles
```

## meta-get

Retrieve raw metadata value by its name. The value is printed to stdout without any modifications. For example, to get
the `description` value from an mbtiles file:

```bash
mbtiles meta-get my_file.mbtiles description
```

## meta-set

Set metadata value by its name, or delete the key if no value is supplied. For example, to set the `description` value
to `A vector tile dataset`:

```bash
mbtiles meta-set my_file.mbtiles description "A vector tile dataset"
```
