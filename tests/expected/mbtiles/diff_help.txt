Compare two files A and B, and generate a new diff file. If the diff file is applied to A, it will produce B

Usage: mbtiles diff [OPTIONS] <FILE1> <FILE2> <DIFF>

Arguments:
  <FILE1>
          First MBTiles file to compare

  <FILE2>
          Second MBTiles file to compare

  <DIFF>
          Output file to write the resulting difference to

Options:
      --patch-type <PATCH_TYPE>
          Specify the type of patch file to generate
          
          [default: whole]

          Possible values:
          - whole:        Patch file will contain the entire tile if it is different from the source
          - bin-diff-gz:  Use bin-diff to store only the bytes changed between two versions of each tile. Treats content as gzipped blobs, decoding them before diffing
          - bin-diff-raw: Use bin-diff to store only the bytes changed between two versions of each tile. Treats content as blobs without any special encoding

      --copy <TYPE>
          Limit what gets copied. When copying tiles only, the agg_tiles_hash will still be updated unless --skip-agg-tiles-hash is set
          
          [default: all]
          [possible values: all, metadata, tiles]

      --mbtiles-type <SCHEMA>
          Output format of the destination file, ignored if the file exists. If not specified, defaults to the type of source
          
          [possible values: flat, flat-with-hash, normalized]

      --on-duplicate <ON_DUPLICATE>
          Allow copying to existing files, and indicate what to do if a tile with the same Z/X/Y already exists
          
          [possible values: override, ignore, abort]

      --min-zoom <MIN_ZOOM>
          Minimum zoom level to copy

      --max-zoom <MAX_ZOOM>
          Maximum zoom level to copy

      --zoom-levels <ZOOM_LEVELS>
          List of zoom levels to copy

      --bbox <BBOX>
          Bounding box to copy, in the format min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat. Can be used multiple times

      --skip-agg-tiles-hash
          Skip generating a global hash for mbtiles validation. By default, mbtiles will compute agg_tiles_hash metadata value

  -f, --force
          Force copy operation, ignoring some warnings that otherwise would prevent the operation. Use with caution

      --validate
          Perform agg_hash validation on the original and destination files

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
