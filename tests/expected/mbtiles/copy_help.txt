Copy tiles from one mbtiles file to another

Usage: mbtiles copy [OPTIONS] <SRC_FILE> <DST_FILE>

Arguments:
  <SRC_FILE>
          MBTiles file to read from

  <DST_FILE>
          MBTiles file to write to

Options:
      --copy <TYPE>
          Limit what gets copied. When copying tiles only, the agg_tiles_hash will still be updated unless --skip-agg-tiles-hash is set
          
          [default: all]
          [possible values: all, metadata, tiles]

      --mbtiles-type <SCHEMA>
          Output format of the destination file, ignored if the file exists. If not specified, defaults to the type of source
          
          [possible values: flat, flat-with-hash, normalized]

      --on-duplicate <ON_DUPLICATE>
          Allow copying to existing files, and indicate what to do if a tile with the same Z/X/Y already exists
          
          [possible values: override, ignore, abort]

      --min-zoom <MIN_ZOOM>
          Minimum zoom level to copy

      --max-zoom <MAX_ZOOM>
          Maximum zoom level to copy

      --zoom-levels <ZOOM_LEVELS>
          List of zoom levels to copy

      --bbox <BBOX>
          Bounding box to copy, in the format min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat. Can be used multiple times

      --skip-agg-tiles-hash
          Skip generating a global hash for mbtiles validation. By default, mbtiles will compute agg_tiles_hash metadata value

  -f, --force
          Force copy operation, ignoring some warnings that otherwise would prevent the operation. Use with caution

      --validate
          Perform agg_hash validation on the original and destination files

      --diff-with-file <DIFF_WITH_FILE>
          Compare source file with this file, and only copy non-identical tiles to destination. Use mbtiles diff as a more convenient way to generate this file. Use mbtiles
          apply-patch or mbtiles copy --apply-patch to apply the diff file

      --apply-patch <APPLY_PATCH>
          Apply a patch file while copying src to dst. Use mbtiles diff or mbtiles copy --diff-with-file to generate the patch file. Use mbtiles apply-patch to apply the
          patch file in-place, without making a copy of the original

      --patch-type <PATCH_TYPE>
          Specify the type of patch file to generate
          
          [default: whole]

          Possible values:
          - whole:        Patch file will contain the entire tile if it is different from the source
          - bin-diff-gz:  Use bin-diff to store only the bytes changed between two versions of each tile. Treats content as gzipped blobs, decoding them before diffing
          - bin-diff-raw: Use bin-diff to store only the bytes changed between two versions of each tile. Treats content as blobs without any special encoding

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
